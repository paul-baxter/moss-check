#/bin/bash
# to_UTF8.sh
#   script to convert UTF-16 from Visual Studio to UTF-8
#
#   usage:  to_UTF8.sh filename
#   or      to_UTF8.sh filename 2>/dev/null      to ignore output
#
#       if file is UTF8 to begin with, no change is made
#       if file is UTF-16, original file is renamed to (original_name).utf16
#           converted to UTF-8, and the resulting file has the same name
#           as the original file.
#
#   CAVEAT:  will not handle filenames with spaces!
